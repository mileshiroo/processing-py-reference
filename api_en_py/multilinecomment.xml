Explanatory notes embedded within the code. Comments are used to remind yourself and to inform others about the function of your program. Multiline comments are used for large text descriptions of code or to comment out chunks of code while debugging applications. In Python, multiline comments are actually multiline strings, but they are ignored by the interpreter.
