Stops Processing from continuously executing the code within <b>draw()</b>. If <b>loop()</b> is called, the code in <b>draw()</b> begins to run continuously again. If using <b>noLoop()</b> in <b>setup()</b>, it should be the last line inside the block.<br/>
<br/>
When <b>noLoop()</b> is used, it's not possible to manipulate or access the screen inside event handling functions such as <b>mousePressed()</b> or <b>keyPressed()</b>. Instead, use those functions to call <b>redraw()</b> or <b>loop()</b>, which will run <b>draw()</b>, which can update the screen properly. This means that when <b>noLoop()</b> has been called, no drawing can happen, and functions like <b>saveFrame()</b> or <b>loadPixels()</b> may not be used.<br/>
<br/>
Note that if the sketch is resized, <b>redraw()</b> will be called to update the sketch, even after <b>noLoop()</b> has been specified. Otherwise, the sketch would enter an odd state until <b>loop()</b> was called.
