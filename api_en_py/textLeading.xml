<description><![CDATA[
Sets the spacing between lines of text in units of pixels. This setting will be used in all subsequent calls to the <b>text()</b> function.  Note, however, that the leading is reset by <b>textSize()</b>. For example, if the leading is set to 20 with <b>textLeading(20)</b>, then if <b>textSize(48)</b> is run at a later point, the leading will be reset to the default for the text size of 48.
